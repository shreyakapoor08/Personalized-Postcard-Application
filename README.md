## Introduction

I have developed a web application to facilitate the sharing of personalized postcards among users. The 
primary objective of the application is to provide users with a platform where they can create customized 
postcards online and share it with their loved ones.
Key Features:
1. Customized Postcard: Users can create personalized postcards by adding their own 
handwritten messages in a document. Additionally, users have the option to upload photos to 
include in their postcards to have a personal touch. 
2. Handwritten Recognition: The application incorporates handwriting recognition technology 
to convert handwritten messages on uploaded documents into text. This feature enhances the 
user experience by allowing handwritten messages to be easily incorporated into the 
postcards.
3. Sharing Functionality: Once a postcard is created, users can share it with their intended 
recipients by generating a shareable link or by clicking on view postcard. This link can be 
sent via email or shared through other messaging platforms
